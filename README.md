# WaifuBrew

Still building...

WaifuBrew is standalone Java application mimicking visual novel. Main point of this project is to play around with Java for various of different aspects (Graphics, File, Audio, and program structure). Not only learning Java is learning objective, but also Github as well.

Logs:
4/2 - Finished basic GUI [BetaStar] and basic JSON retrieval [Gaia]

4/4 - GUI update. Introduced start screen. Implementation of buttons and stages. Resolution bugs (placement & scaling) were now properly calculated. The window (JFrame) is now locked since it adds no benefit and causesÂ elements to break. [BetaStar]
